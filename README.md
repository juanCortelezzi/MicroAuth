# Authentication Microservices (WIP)

Trying to setup authentication microservices with the ORY suite, using Kratos to
handle authentication and Oathkeeper to handle proxy and Identity and Access
Proxy (IAP).

Since we are 2 experienced developers working on this project, we absolutely
know what we are doing and do not need any help whatsoever.

## Documentation
- [Oathkeeper documentation](https://www.ory.sh/docs/oathkeeper)
- [Kratos documentation](https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos)

## Status

By now, only Kratos is working. Oathkeeper needs come configuration tweaking
since I believe there are multiple port mismatches. Moreover, some paths seem to
be incorrect and for god sake I cannot figure out the purpose of various
environment variables.
